# **Overview :**
The aim of this project is to develop an e-commerce microservices application that
can be deployed on the cloud using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Git. The
application will consist of several microservices that will be deployed as Docker
containers on a Kubernetes cluster. Jenkins will be used for continuous integration
and deployment, while Git will be used for version control.


# **Objectives:**
1) Design and implement the microservices architecture for the application.
2) Create Docker containers for each microservice.
3) Use Kubernetes to orchestrate the containers locally.
4) Implement a Jenkins pipeline to automate the deployment process.
5) Integrate Git with Jenkins to trigger the pipeline on code changes.
